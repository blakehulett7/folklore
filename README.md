At the present moment, Folklore is only available for linux users. This will change at some point, but for now, only my fellow software engineers can embark on this journey.

If you're itching to get started, feel free to skip ahead to the quick start section. The TLDR of our mission is that stories rock and are how everybody should learn!
## Our Mission
### The Problem with Modern Language Learning
One of the defining characteristics of humanity is our ability to use language. Take a second and think about this. There is a long unbroken chain from all the way back in ancient history when language was first developed to you sitting here reading this. For countless millinnea, we have successfully passed down our language to the next generation and continued that cycle. Yet when you go to learn a new language, it never seems to stick. Ask yourself this, do you honestly remember any Spanish from class in High School? What about from that time you tried duolingo? The reason for this is simple. Our current techniques for teaching new languages are simply bad. 
### A New Way Forward... A Lesson from the Past!
This is why we created Folklore. Our mission is to build an accessible way for anyone to pick up a new language. The key to ensuring success can be found in our shared history. Long before the modern age, even before the invention of writing itself, we have used the magical power of storytelling to teach our kids how to talk. We believe that regular engagement in this rich human tradition remains the best way to learn a new language, and Folklore does exactly that. You will embark on a journey of learning the local folklore of your chosen language through the power of stories. This ensures that not only will you learn how to talk like a local, you will also get a taste of the rich culture that you are engaging with. Through this method, you can feel a stronger connection to the language and the people that use it. Our hope is that through this, the overall unity of humanity will increase!
